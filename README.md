✨ **An experimental project using NX, two NodeJS services, a NextJS client, and GraphQL** ✨

## Development server

Run `nx serve client` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `nx serve api-1` to start api-1

Run `nx serve api-2` to start api-2

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
