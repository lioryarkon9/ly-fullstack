✨ **An experimental project using NX, two NodeJS services, a NextJS client, and GraphQL: A ChatGPT based birthday greeting generator** ✨

## Development server

Run `nx serve bday-greetings` for a dev server of the web app. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

Run `nx serve instruction-generator` to start instruction-generator - a service that takes the details of the birthday boy/girl, and generates a template of instruction that can be provided to chatGPT

Run `nx serve ai` to start ai - a service that takes the instruction generated by the 'instruction-generator' and communicates with the chatGPT api

## Understand this workspace

Run `nx graph` to see a diagram of the dependencies of the projects.

## Remote caching

Run `npx nx connect-to-nx-cloud` to enable [remote caching](https://nx.app) and make CI faster.
